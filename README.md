- ðŸŸ¡ Phone Interview (Yellow)
- ðŸŸ  Technical Interview (Orange)
- ðŸŸ¢ Offer (Green)
- ðŸ”´ Rejected (Red)
- âš« No Answer (Gray)

### Importing Data

Applied,Google,Software Engineer,https://careers.google.com,2025-01-15
Phone Interview,Amazon,Data Scientist,https://amazon.jobs,2025-01-20
```

**Format 2: Multiple Stages (recommended)**
```csv
Company,Position,Link,Applied,Phone Interview,Technical Interview,Offer
Google,Software Engineer,https://careers.google.com,2025-01-15,2025-01-20,2025-01-25,

3. **Update Regularly**: Add dates as soon as you complete a stage
4. **Multiple Projects**: Create separate projects for different job search types
